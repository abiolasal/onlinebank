# onlinebanking
This is a project carried out as part of a course requirement. It was done by a team of 5 members.For this project, security is very important, so we have used php and html functions that help to prevent the common e-cpmmerce app attacks like, sql injection, code injection - csrf, xss, buffer overflow and many others.
I worked on the Customer, staff and admin login/logout pages, and their corresponding dashboards.

Usage:
1.Install XAMPP or WAMPP or the like
2.Copy the extracted files and folders into c:/xampp/htdocs/onlinebanking
3.Create a db named as 'test' and import the test.sql from phpMyAdmin.
4.change the password in _inc/dbconn.php file accordingly.

url for customer index page will be localhost/onlinebank
url for admin logon page will be localhost/onlinebank/adminlogin.php
url for staff logon page will be localhost/onlinebank/staff_login.php
